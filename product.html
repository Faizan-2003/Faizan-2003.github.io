                    <strong>Global story</strong>
                    In football, goal-line technology is the use of electronic aid to determine if the goal has been scored or
                    not. In detail, it is a method used to determine when the ball has completely crossed the goal line in
                    between the goal-posts and underneath the crossbar with the assistance of electronic devices and at the same
                    time help the referee in allocating a goal or not. The objective of goal-line technology (GLT) is not to
                    replace the role of the officials, but rather to support them in their decision-making..

                    <strong>Solution by this Innovation</strong>
                    Goal-line technology has helped the game of football in many. First, it has improved goal-scoring accuracy,
                    which has led to more goals being scored. Second, it makes games less controversial, as all goals are now
                    clear to see and there can be no arguments about whether the ball crossed the line or not. Third, it also
                    helps referees make better decisions because they can now rely on accurate data when deciding whether to
                    count a goal or not. Fourthly, and probably most importantly, this technology is much faster than human
                   subjectivity at making decisions.

                   <strong>How to Use this Technology</strong>
                   Goal-Line Technology is a system that uses either physical cameras or a changing magnetic field to track the
                   ball and determine if it has crossed the goal line. If the ball crosses the line, an encrypted signal is
                   transmitted to the referee, who can then decide whether or not to award a goal. Hawk-Eye, the first
                   ball-tracking technology in action, uses cameras to triangulate and track the ball's location. With seven
                   cameras pointed at each goal, Hawk-Eye can still be effective even if a few of the cameras are blocked

                  <strong>Users of this Technology</strong>
                  Due to the expense of goal-line technology systems, the technology is only currently used at the very top
                  levels of the game. In domestic competition, goal-line technology is only regularly used in a few major
                  European league including Serie A, Bundesliga, the premier league(EPL), the EFL champion league, Ligue 1,
                  and selected matches in the Eredivisie. The only major league without it is La Liga.
                  As of January 2020, FIFA's website list 109 stadiums with licensed GLT installations, 106 of which use the
                  Hawk-Eye system. The other three use Goal Control, which is the other licensed provider.

                  <strong>Expectations form the Product</strong>
                  The International Football Association Board requires that goal-line technology (GLT) does not interfere
                  with the game. As a consequence the requirements were set up to determine that only the match officials are
                  to receive a signal to indicate whether or not the entire ball has crossed the line.
                  The information is transmitted within one second which ensures an immediate response from the referee. Due
                  to this design there are no stoppages or other forms of interference in the game. The match officials are
                  the only ones to receive the signal on their watches.

                   <strong>Future by this Innovation</strong> 
                    At present, the GLT system is only a project, yet it is bound to become a part of reality soon since the
                    testing has already begun and there are certain results delivered concerning the issue of the GLT and its
                    accuracy. Even though the results are considered favourable at present, there is going to be a series of
                    other tests which are bound either to prove the GLT viability or to cancel the use of the new technology for
                    good.
                    The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body which implements rules, is currently
                    undertaking a second round of testing to see if several technologies are viable for introduction to
                    football3‚Äù, which means that the GLT is not the only option which referees have as a way to support their
                    judgments concerning the goals and the winners.
