              <h2>Goal-Line Technology (GLT)</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              <strong><em>Goal-Line Technology</em></strong> debuted in the 2014
              World Cup in Brazil and it was also an important part if the tech
              used a couple of years ago in Russia at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
              With Goal-Line Technology(GLT), 14 cameras capture up to 500
              frames per second and send the image to an image processing
              system. The 3D coordinates of the ball are monitored, and when the
              entire ball crosses the goal line the camera capture it and sends
              a signal to the referee's watch. Goal Control is still providing
              the technology throughout significant football competitions around
              the globe, as it did in Brazil.

              <h2>Video Assistant Referee (VAR)</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              A new generation of video technology was used in the 2018 FIFA
              World Cup in Russia, Called
              <strong><em>Video Assistant Referee</em></strong
              >, to assist in officiating. The VAR team supports teh referees
              form a centralised video operations room at the international
              broadcast centre of the stadium. One video Assistant referee,
              three assistants, and four replay operators make the group, which
              has access to all 33 camera feeds covering the matches, plus
              exclusive access to two special offside cameras. Two cameras are
              turned on the refs themselves, so their decision process will be
              public. The tech is only used in situations where a call may have
              changed the result of the match. If a "Clear and obvious error"
              has been made, the team communicates with the on-field refs and
              they can stop at any time to consult with the VAR team.

              to control and improve player and team Performance. EPTS primarily
              track player and ball positions but can also be used in
              combination with microelectronic devices (such as accelerometers
              and gyroscopes) and heart-rate monitors, as well as other devices
              to measure load or physiological parameters. These devies are used
              in combination with Micro Electrical Mechanical devices (such as
              accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses) to provide inertial load
              and other medical information. Each team has three EPTS devices.
              One is for the analyst in the stands, another is for the analyst
              on the bench, and the third is for the medical team.
